# 🏋️ IFRMS — Integrated Fitness & Resource Management System

> A web application to manage gym memberships, resources, staff, and fitness tracking — built as a DBMS course project.

---

## 📖 About the Project

This project was developed as a **team project for the DBMS (CS2011E) course** at the **National Institute of Technology Calicut (NITC)**, under the guidance of **Dr. A. Sudarshan Chakravarthy**.

### 💡 The Inspiration

The idea came from a real problem faced by some of our gym-going friends — including one of our own team members. At our college gym, members are required to **physically visit the gym every month just to renew their membership**, and all money transactions are recorded manually in a notebook. There's no digital record, no convenience, and no accountability.

We decided to take on this problem as our DBMS project and build a dedicated web application to address it.

> **Note:** The current version of IFRMS focuses on **membership management and resource management** only. It is not a complete solution to the problem we described. We are planning to integrate **online payment for membership renewal** directly within the application in a future version.

## 🎯 Aim

To design and develop a **complete, working web application** dedicated to managing:
- Gym resources (equipment, scheduling)
- Customer memberships and fitness tracking
- Staff (trainers and admins)
